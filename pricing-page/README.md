## Overview:

Develop a responsive pricing page using Tailwind CSS. The page will consist of three pricing plans: Basic, Plus, and Pro. The Plus plan should stand out as the "Most Popular" choice.

## 📝 General Instructions

1. **Starting Point**: The provided `index.html` comes with an empty body. Your main task is to structure the content using appropriate semantic HTML elements. This will lay the foundation for the subsequent Tailwind CSS styling.

2. **Styling with Tailwind**: For styling, use ONLY Tailwind CSS classes. Refrain from writing custom CSS. The Tailwind documentation will be instrumental for this task, so ensure you have it handy.

3. **Responsiveness**: Your design should be mobile-responsive. As you craft the page, frequently check its appearance on different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Make use of TailwindCSS responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust the design based on these breakpoints.

4. **Review**: After completing the exercise, thoroughly inspect your page to confirm it aligns with all the stipulated requirements. Always prioritize clean, organized, and commented code where necessary.
